        This is a <strong>Single Page Application (SPA)</strong> built entirely with <strong>Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and Bootstrap</strong>. No frameworks, just the basics.
      </p>
      <p class="about-text">
        I decided to create this site to share some of the <strong>animes I enjoy the most</strong> and to learn the very basics of frontend development.
      </p>
      <p class="about-text">
        Everything you see the navigation, the dynamic content and the page updates is made with JavaScript alone. No page reloads, no external libraries, just clean, responsive design and interactive features made from scratch.
